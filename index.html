            <p>My review is about one of the industry’s most admired books:  Information Architecture for the Web and Beyond.  For the fourth edition, the authors of this book – Peter Morville and Lou Rosenfeld have teamed up with Jorge Arango to review the classic text on information architecture, which had not been revised in a decade – since 2006.  Even though the book confronts a much more complex digital environment, it describes practices and methods that are just as relevant today as they were ten years ago.  It provides essential concept, methods and techniques for digital design that have withstood the test of time.   While the fundamental principles of Information Architecture as a practice remain fairly static, the examples used are modern and the technologies referenced are current, it delivers relevance by remixing and fine tuning the classic themes that have made it the successful book it has been across the fourth editions.</p>
<h6 id="Who-is-the-audience-of-this-book"><a href="#Who-is-the-audience-of-this-book" class="headerlink" title="Who is the audience of this book?"></a>Who is the audience of this book?</h6><p>This book is for those who are new to the practice and also for the general digital-design practitioners who just want to refresh their thinking about the fundamental principles of Information Architecture.</p>
<p>The underlying information architecture of a digital-information environment should not be taken lightly. UX Architects and web designers of these environments – not necessarily people who call themselves Information Architects – should be aware of the basic challenges and tactics this book presents.  Consequently, this book is required reading for anyone who wants to specialize in information architecture.</p>
<h6 id="Relevance-to-interactive-media-industry"><a href="#Relevance-to-interactive-media-industry" class="headerlink" title="Relevance to interactive media industry"></a>Relevance to interactive media industry</h6><p>First and foremost, I would like to give a few examples about unethical leadership when I was working for a global online English school a couple of years ago in Shanghai.  Most of my colleagues came from different countries all around the world. We had different culture, different academic background; some of them were gays, Islam, Buddhist, etc… My concerns about team diversity made me reconsider the importance of value and culture in a multinational company.</p>
<p>My first unethical leadership example:</p>
<p>One day, I received an email written by a female Vice President (name M) who supervised the department of customer relationship for worldwide offices. The VP was a senior business expert, a typical US style woman full of bravado, but with a smiling assassin.  From her email, we got to know that one of her underling staffs (name T), a young Taiwanese, he resigned and decided to pursue dream of starting his own business. A few days later, staff T’s coworker, a Taiwanese girl (name J) told us staff T stole trade secrets from company and sold them, it was detected by Vice President M and then she fired staff T without advance notice.  “The Vice President M, she is a big liar.” my Taiwanese colleague J said.  From my point of view, staff T violated the confidentiality owed to the company, his behavior was illegal.  Holding on a leadership position, the Vice President M fired employee who had disregarded company policy, it’s legal, but not unethical – for lying to employees.  On the other hand, she was unwilling to recognize her management oversight for her department.</p>
<p>The second unethical leadership example happened in the same company:</p>
<p>My Chinese colleague (name H) worked in the Department of Teacher Administration.  She was a very introverted and self-critical girl who was capable of providing excellent work in her area of specialty. Her unique character I had known was she seemed to be that kind of the loudest complainer and was very aware of her work performance. Her manager (name J) was also a Chinese woman who had the talent of flattery and seemed to be acting like someone she thought she had to be instead of as an effective leader, to piggyback on her team members.  I had heard from others in her past work life that she was actually very kind.  One day, colleague H was upset to tell us her dilemma: She was hard working on an individual project and then she made a pretty good presentation to her supervisor J, unfortunately, she didn’t approve it.  Weeks later at meeting room, Manager J successfully pitched the presentation to all the department directors – the one she previously rejected.  Manager J sat down amid deafening applause because those directors all loved her presentation, she took all the credit without shame.  Finally, colleague H decided to leave our company which she had been working for almost seven years. “I have no choice.  I couldn’t bear my boss anymore.” She told us at her last day in the office.</p>
<p>“Power grabs can happen in any corporate environment because the system is simply set up for competition.” Workplace expert Lynn Taylor explained.  From my point of view, those bosses who take all the credit from their employees, they may think it is deserved to take credit for all the good because they have to be accountable for all the harshness critiques and to deal with plenty of challenges and risks in business.  Obviously, their behaviors are unethical.</p>
<p>The third unethical leadership example related to my supervisor in the same company:</p>
<p>Most of my team members in Design Department worked in Hong Kong office. I had a supervisor who worked as an Art Director with several visual designers at there.  He was overly confident, very sarcastic for everything he felt uncomfortable.  Due to the communication style of remote work between Hong Kong and Shanghai in 2006, I had to say “Hello” to my team members by using MSN Messenger with a headset.</p>
<p>One day, one of my colleagues (name V) in Marketing Department rushed towards me.  “I have a question about Photoshop.  Can I change any font size in it?” She seemed anxious about her question.  “You can do whatever you want to change in Photoshop.” I answered.  “But the Art Director in HK told me it’s impossible to change the font size in Photoshop and his designers are unable to fix the image which our marketing team would like to use for the leaflet.” Suddenly colleague V looked angry.  “Can you do me a favor to change the font size in Photoshop? We have to launch this marketing campaign as soon as possible.” “Sure, I’m pretty sure.”</p>
<p>According to the old adage, “The best defense is a good offense.” My supervisor refused to do any extra works due to heavy workload in Hong Kong office. However, it is important for him to understand his role within a team and the responsibilities and obligations that come with that role.  As a result, he was lack the ability to analyze the problem from an ethical perspective.  Rationalization – the ability to justify our behavior – is one of our greatest moral failings.</p>
<h6 id="Characteristics-of-a-successful-ethical-leadership-style"><a href="#Characteristics-of-a-successful-ethical-leadership-style" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of a successful ethical leadership style"></a>Characteristics of a successful ethical leadership style</h6><p>An effective and ethical leader has the following traits and characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ethical leaders have the personality to defy group-think. They are courageous and accept the backlash against their unorthodox practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ethical leaders have the ability to set consistently good example for others to follow. This was as true in ancient China as it is today, summed up by Lao Tzu who observed that: “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.”<font color="blue" size="1"><strong>[5]</strong></font></p>
</li>
<li><p>Ethical leaders are strong on personality of selflessness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ethical leaders are not afraid to be challenged. There can be no “I’m the boss, don’t you dare challenge my authority”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ethical leaders are willing to take responsibility for everything and they accept that they are either directly or indirectly responsible for everything that happens in the workplace.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Several key sentences are founded by me via #DevTo’s Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t let process get in way of collaboration. Designers &amp; devs have to talk to each other all the way from start to finish.</p>
<p>Devs, don’t think that writing code is good, and that questions, process, meetings are bad. Understand business decisions.</p>

<p>After graduation in 2000, I worked in collaboration with my developer colleagues for more than 10 years.

          <p>“<a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> is getting pretty cumbersome” was the first signal when I tried to update it to the latest blogging platform.  Since 2014, I’ve got Wordpress 4.2 up and running on <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">Openshift</a>. Just click few buttons and then enter a few details and it’ll be up and running on live site. Unfortunately, I can’t refer my custom domain without a SSL certificate error when in the backend. Openshift requires $20/month Silver plan to add SSL certificate to my application.  Additionally, the custom rhcloud.com subdomain that Openshift provided is blocked in mainland China, for this apocalyptic reason I decided to change blogging platform from Wordpress to <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.

<p>That’s two great presentations on site. What I mentioned is several students from Sheridan College just sitting beside me. As a professor, Andrew’s pedagogy for this lecture is heuristic by asking questions and to use a typical gift box in white as physical prop.</p>
<p>Thanks for Rangle’s efforts!! At last, I found two lecture videos via their company website.

<p>It was the first time for me to attend Meetup event (group A11yTO) since I had been in Toronto for less than 3 months. At the office of <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/">Shopify</a>, the speaker Terrence Ho was excited to briefly introduce their platform for people with disabilities through VR technology.
