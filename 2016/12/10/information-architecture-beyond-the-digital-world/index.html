        <p>My review is about one of the industry’s most admired books:  Information Architecture for the Web and Beyond.  For the fourth edition, the authors of this book – Peter Morville and Lou Rosenfeld have teamed up with Jorge Arango to review the classic text on information architecture, which had not been revised in a decade – since 2006.  Even though the book confronts a much more complex digital environment, it describes practices and methods that are just as relevant today as they were ten years ago.  It provides essential concept, methods and techniques for digital design that have withstood the test of time.   While the fundamental principles of Information Architecture as a practice remain fairly static, the examples used are modern and the technologies referenced are current, it delivers relevance by remixing and fine tuning the classic themes that have made it the successful book it has been across the fourth editions.<a id="more"></a></p>

<h6 id="Who-is-the-audience-of-this-book"><a href="#Who-is-the-audience-of-this-book" class="headerlink" title="Who is the audience of this book?"></a>Who is the audience of this book?</h6><p>This book is for those who are new to the practice and also for the general digital-design practitioners who just want to refresh their thinking about the fundamental principles of Information Architecture.</p>
<p>The underlying information architecture of a digital-information environment should not be taken lightly. UX Architects and web designers of these environments – not necessarily people who call themselves Information Architects – should be aware of the basic challenges and tactics this book presents.  Consequently, this book is required reading for anyone who wants to specialize in information architecture.</p>
<h6 id="The-importance-of-Information-Architecture-for-UX-industry"><a href="#The-importance-of-Information-Architecture-for-UX-industry" class="headerlink" title="The importance of Information Architecture for UX industry"></a>The importance of Information Architecture for UX industry</h6><p><img src="http://www.dontbeshydigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/londonmap.jpg" alt="This is too easy to use, I hate it - No one, ever"></p>
<p>On a website, information architecture is organizing, labeling, prioritizing, and connecting content to support usability and findability.  In other words, a website with a clear information architecture, it makes a website easier to use and easier to find.  It’s important to create a structure that satisfies the user’s mental model, filling it with content that speaks to their needs and emotions.  There are several reasons why it is so important to build an Information Architecture for your entire product:</p>
<p>Having clearly defined information architecture provides concrete direction to the users.  It provides a translation layer between the business scope and all other views.  Information Architecture identifies a high level organization of the user experience. An Information Architecture shows everything your product offers to users.  The best designed Information Architecture helps designers and developers better understand the context of the features of current product they are working on. It also be a great help to the stakeholders when they are considering which direction to take their product in the future.<font color="blue" size="1"><strong>[1]</strong></font></p>
<h6 id="Information-Architecture’s-role-and-relevance-for-those-UX-professionals"><a href="#Information-Architecture’s-role-and-relevance-for-those-UX-professionals" class="headerlink" title="Information Architecture’s role and relevance for  those UX professionals"></a>Information Architecture’s role and relevance for  those UX professionals</h6><p>Nowadays, Information Architects are on a cusp, poised between being part of the problem or part of the solution.  Should they continue to throw every bit of data we have got onto the web and “let Google sort it out?”  Or do they want to start thinking about why we are putting things onto the Internet, what they want to accomplish by doing so, and how they can best accomplish those goals?”</p>
<p>Through the official website of O’REILLY, I found an article about interviewing Jorge Arango, one of the authors of Information Architecture for the Web and Beyond.  I also listened to the relevant podcast – Information architecture’s role in UX design.  Jorge Arango discussed the state of Information Architecture and the importance of designer’s understanding of context and perspective.<font color="blue" size="1"><strong>[2]</strong></font></p>
<p>When Arango moved his topic on some kinds of the skills that make a great designer, he mentioned every designer should consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>“It’s important to know your possibilities as well as your limits, but also to be able to think about your work in its broader context.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“For Information Architects or whatever designers, to learn a bit more about everything, to have a broader understanding of outside their fields including business literacy and even programming.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“When it comes to teams, to share with your team members a little bit more about your insights and what you think are one of the most important skills for you to get involved in your industry.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following quote is from Getting Real, a popular book on how to build a successful web application, which goes on to say, “Small teams need people who can wear different hats” and “Everyone should have an idea about how to architect information (whatever that may mean).” These are controversial statements, but I assume that many information architects would agree that there’s some truth in them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get well-rounded individuals. Go for quick-learning generalists over ingrained specialists…. We’ll never hire someone who’s an information architect. It’s just too overly specific. With a small team like ours, it doesn’t make sense to hire people with such a narrowly defined skillset.” — from Getting Real <font color="blue" size="1"><strong>[3]</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To become an excellent Information Architect practitioners. They need to be prepared for life-long learning in all aspects of their craft, but particularly in terms of their Web development skills. The web is rapidly and constantly evolving, and Information Architect need to keep up with these changes.<br>Part of life-long learning in relation to web development skills involves keeping abreast of the latest best practices.</p>
<p>Information Architects need to know what’s possible and have at least a general idea of how to go about making it happen. In other words, they need to understand everything that a developer understands. But they also need to be aware of many other issues — notably everything to do with usability — so must know more than anyone else on their team. This is a huge demand and, inevitably, at the start of their career, Information Architects  won’t know more than everyone else on a Web development team. But they should recognize that their career path should, ideally, lead them in that direction.</p>
